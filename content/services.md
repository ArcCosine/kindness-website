# Services

This service was developed as a hobby.


# nyaan

[nyaan](https://nyaan.work) is a service that allows you to easily post cat meows to Twitter. It is built entirely in Pure JavaScript and is a study of the recent PWAs. It utilizes netlify's functionality to dynamically generate Twitter cards.

# Kindness-webpage

[Kindness web page](https://www.tunsns.net) is this site.
Various pages are automatically converted from markdown files to HTML.

# Go-chi-u-cycle

[ごちうサイクル - ご注文はサイクルですか？ -](https://arccosine.github.io/go-chi-u-cycle/) is a website completely made up of stories.
You can just turn the cute icons. It is also in 3D.


# 総人口推移グラフ

[総人口推移グラフ](https://arccosine.github.io/total-population-graph/) was construct as a sample response to a [フロントエンドコーディング試験](https://notion.yumemi.co.jp/0e9ef27b55704d7882aab55cc86c999d).
It was to gauge how quickly I could build it with my current abilities.
The base part took 3 hours to complete and Ver 1 took about 7 hours.
Including refactoring, etc, it would be completed in a week with one hand on the job, as per the immediate goal.
