# About Me

- Name: [ArcCosine](https://twitter.com/ArcCosine/)
- Favorite tools: [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/ja/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/),  [Happy Hacking Keyboard](https://happyhackingkb.com/jp/)

I am expert in JavaScript.
I'm especially good at front-end stuff.
I'm not currently accepting work, sorry.


As for recent developments, here's [a blog](https://looxu.blogspot.com/) post about it.\(mostly in Japanese.\)


I have many feelings about various tools, but I especially like [HHKB](https://happyhackingkb.com/jp/) so much that I have purchased several of them.
I am such a person, but recently I have become interested in self-made keyboards.

# Editor

I love the Vim!
No matter which programming language you work with, everything is handled in Vim.

# Terminal


I can handle any terminal environment myself, but the one I have been working with the longest is probably the [command prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands):).
I have recently started using [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) on Mac OS.
